                <h2>Character biography</h2>
                <p>Tokyo is a young thief on the run from the police after a failed robbery in which her boyfriend was killed. Her mother tried to hand her over to the police before she was involved in the heist, but later died of cardiac arrest, potentially from stress. She was hired by the Professor to help in carrying out a heist of the Royal Mint in Madrid. Together with the other seven robbers chosen for the heist, she is taken to a secluded villa where they plan the heist for five months. The Professor asks each of the robbers to choose a city name to hide their identities during the robbery and she chooses Tokyo. Tokyo is a flirty and rebellious character, and she has a relationship with Rio, that stops and starts throughout the first heist. She shares a good friendship with Nairobi, the two having gotten drunk together many times. She doesn’t like being told what to do and shows dislike for Berlin in the first series.

                <h2>Development</h2>

                <p>The producers found Tokyo among the hardest characters to develop,as they were originally looking for an older actress to play the character who had nothing to lose before meeting the Professor. Úrsula Corberó eventually landed the role for bringing a playful energy to the role; her voice was heavily factored in during casting, as she was the first voice the audience hears in the show.Corberó described Tokyo at the beginning of the show as "a girl who really lacks self-esteem, has been very lonely, has had a very bad time [and] has not had a father figure at home", resulting in a vulnerability that the character doesn't know how to express.Actor Álvaro Morte (the Professor) regarded Tokyo as one of the Professor's favourite gang members, since both characters confide in and confront each other like best friends despite being opposite.</p>

                  <h2>Character biography</h2>
                  <p>The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was. His grandfather had fought against the fascists in Italy. He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists. He controlled the heist through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.[2] The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator leading the case against the heist. He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement with the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of her poor memory and deleting the voicemail. The Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldn’t think of. His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be printed and the team to escape.

                  <h2>Characterization</h2>

                  <p>Elena Pita of El Mundo described the character as "enigmatic".Alvaro Morte said the character was a "workaholic".He linked the Professor to his role of Óscar in El embarcadero, both of whom "had to be demonized". He said that viewers felt close to the character because he generates empathy, and that "if the viewer does not empathize with the Professor or Oscar, the series does not work"</p>
                  <h2>Development</h2>
                  <p>
                    Early in development, the Professor was intended to be the narrator of the series.Writer Javier Gómez Santander compared the writing process to the Professor's way of thinking, "going around, writing down options, consulting engineers whom you cannot tell why you ask them that", but noted that fiction allowed the police to be written as dumber or more inept when necessary.

Meanwhile, he starts a coercive relationship with a hostage named Ariadna. In the final minutes of part 2, Berlin sacrifices himself so that the gang can escape, dying under police fire. Despite his death, he appears in a main role in part 3 through flashbacks to several years earlier, showing his original planning of the Bank of Spain heist and being married to a woman named Tatiana. Berlin is seen to be proficient in other languages than Spanish including English, Italian and Portuguese.

                    <h2>Characterization</h2>

                    <p>La Voz de Galicia characterised Berlin as a "cold, hypnotic, sophisticated, and disturbing character, an inveterate macho with serious empathy problems, a white-collar thief who despises his colleagues and considers them inferior".Joana Oliveira of El País described Berlin in parts 1 and 2 as "obnoxious" and "a snob, a misogynist, and a bit sadistic",which La Vanguardia contrasted with the character's portrayal in the flashbacks in part 3, where he appeared "much more in love and cuddly". Actor Pedro Alonso described Berlin as "cruel, heroic, and funny at the same time" and saw Berlin's high observational skills and an unusual understanding of his surroundings, resulting in unconventional and unpredictable character behaviour. Although capable of empathy, Berlin often did not show it and was "deeply human and deeply ardent", causing chaos in his interactions with others. Alonso attributed Berlin's popularity to the character's desire to live and "enjoy everything at the moment intensely", living "life as a fantastic dream [...] with great honesty, without abiding by conventions and morals".</p>

                        <p>Denver was raised by his father Moscow, who abandoned Denver's mother at a roundabout due her drug use. For many years, Moscow led Denver to believe that his mother abandoned him.

                          Denver was one of the robbers participating in the Royal Mint of Spain heist alongside his father, Agustín Ramos (Moscow). His father invited Denver to join the heist due some issues that he was having with traffickers.

                          During the heist, Moscow reveals the truth about Denver's mother, resulting in an argument and rift in their relationship. However, he is forgiven shortly afterwards when Moscow dies after being shot by police.

                          <h2>Character biography</h2>
                          <p>Rio was born in Getafe. His nickname given by his mother was Rayo, meaning lightning bolt in Spanish. At young age he became interested in computers and began programming at the age of 6. He often locked himself in his room for hours. His parents believed that he was working or playing on his computer, but he was actually beginning his career as a hacker.

                            In 2010, he engaged in multiple cyber-attacks, which were all done discretely so the police couldn’t track him. He stole banking data and attacked North American servers. These hacks were reported by several online newspapers such as La Voz, La Nación, El Diario.com, however his identity was never discovered.
                            Rio took part in the heist at the Royal Mint of Spain heist. During the learning process and preparation for the heist, he developed feelings for his fellow robber Tokyo and they began a secret relationship despite The Professor's request for participants not to fraternize. On the day before the heist, he gives Tokyo a dogtag necklace with his real name and proposes to her.

                        <div class="col-12 col-md-4 my-3">

                          <h2>Personality</h2>

                          <p>Rio is playful, naïve, and innocent compared to his fellow crew members, causing him to be considered the "weakest link". His naïvety caused problems, which drove the Professor to kick him out of the group, however Tokyo stopped it.

                          Rio still cares for his family. He was upset upon hearing his parents talk about their disappointment and was emotional when he watched the video of his parents. He considered surrendering himself, but later decided to continue with the heist.</p>
                          <h2>Skills</h2>

                          <p>Rio is a very skilled hacker, having attacked multiple websites and being recruited as the tech expert for a very complicated heist. He is shown to have enough knowledge of the deep web to know where he can buy weapons.

                            According to the Spanish police, he is an alarm expert that worked in a security company for 2 years.[7]

                          Rio is shown to be at least a bit skilled with weapons, knowing how to use them. As stated by Alison Parker, he doesn’t hold a weapon like a professional. He is supposed to be skilled in all the things the professor taught him and his fellow crew members, although some have never been shown.</p>

                            <h2>Character biography</h2>
                            <p>Mónica is well-educated and learns quickly. She only took 6 weeks to prepare for the entrance exams to get a job at the Royal Mint of Spain. While working as a secretary there, she begins an affair with Arturo Román.


                              At the time of the heist, Mónica was pregnant with Arturo Román's child.

                              At the start of the heist she is in the storage facility with Arturo. She had just told Arturo she was pregnant, and the two got into an argument. In the middle of the fight, the Robbers of the Royal Mint of Spain take them hostage. When the robbers take over the mint, they close the security door and make Monica tell people outside the Royal Mint of Spain that it is a technical malfunction.

                              Early during the heist, Berlin tells the hostages that they will request any medicine the hostages need, and Monica requests an abortion pill. Later, Arturo asks her to grab the phone hidden in his jacket pocket located in his office. When Monica goes to accept her pill, she is able to sneak past Oslo to grab the phone. When she successfully retrieves it, she hides it in her red jumpsuit. As she leaves the room, she is stopped by Denver. Denver tries to talk Mónica out of aborting her child, even giving her money for the child. Berlin interrupts the two of them and as Monica leaves the phone unexpectedly goes off. Berlin orders Denver to execute her.

                              Denver brings Mónica to the mint's bathroom where she begs for her life. Denver struggles to kill her, missing his first gun shot. The two of them then devise a plan to keep Monica alive. Monica tells Denver to shoot her in the leg, as it will bleed a lot.

                            <p>
                              Denver follows through and shoots her in the leg to fake her death. Berlin checks to see if the job is done, and Monica is able to fool him. Monica tells Denver he can hide her in Vault 2, a vault she has access to.

                              Mónica remains hidden in the vault for a while with the bullet lodged inside her leg. Denver works to help heal the wound on her leg, but Monica initially refuses to allow Denver to remove the bullet. Upon hearing about his son "murdering" a woman, Moscow becomes distressed and blamed himself for getting Denver involved in the heist. When Moscow goes to get air with some of the hostages, Arturo Román is accidentally shot. After this, Moscow discovers Monica is alive with Denver. He realizes that they need to remove the bullet with a scalpel.

                              Upon hearing of Arturo's injury, Monica gives Denver a note to give to Arturo while he goes to steal a scalpel from the surgeon brought in to work on Arturo. As Denver steals the scalpel, he decides he can't give Arturo the note and accidentally drops it. Nairobi notices the note, and follows Denver to Vault 2. There she discovers Monica and helps Moscow and Denver remove the bullet and patch Monica up.

                              After having healed, Monica leaves the vault after feeling too confined. Denver is initially mad, but realizes he can't keep her in the vault forever, so he brings her to the mint's bathroom. There, Berlin speaks to Denver, when Berlin realizes Denver is not alone, and discovers Monica is alive. Berlin is a mix of angry and happy with Monica's survival, and he brings her to the break room to show the professor there have been no actual hostage casualties.

                              <h2>Character biography</h2>
                              <p>Raquel Murillo Fuentes was a Spanish Police Inspector based in Madrid. After the crumbling of her marital relationship with Alberto Vicuña, she filed a restraining order against him, and got full custody of her daughter, due to the accusation of his abuse.


                                Raquel Murillo was called on her day off, and asked to be the negotiator of the heist occurring at the Royal Mint. She agreed, and told the operator to send a car, and they tell her that it's already outside. From this, we can infer that Raquel was a trusted and well-liked Inspector.

                                Throughout the heist, she was responsible for negotiating with The Professor.

                                Despite being a more than capable investigator, she is tricked by The Professor, who gets closer to her under his false identity of Salva Martín in order to affect police activity. Although she eventually sees through the ruse, she falls in love with him and they run away together after the conclusion of the heist.

                              <h2>Personality</h2>

                              <p>Raquel is strong and calm. She holds her own in the male dominated Police Corps. She was responsible for negotiating with The Professor.

                                However, Raquel can also be manipulated. She was abused by her husband Alberto Vicuña, which likely affected her self-confidence. The Professor used this knowledge to his advantage during the negotiation.

                              Raquel cares deeply for her family. She is forgiving of her mother Mariví Fuentes, even when she jeopardises the investigation and allows her abusive ex-husband to spend time her daughter Paula Vicuña Murillo. She took her mother and daughter to the Philippines with her, and was clearly concerned when the police threatened to go to the Philippines to find them.</p>
